<h3>Getting Started with HelloJava and MainClass</h3>

<h4>If you're new to Java, follow these steps to get started:</h4>
NB: <p>- Before starting this new coding experience, you must refer to the official Oracle website for the complete installation of Java JDK.
       - Also you have to have an IDE of your choice. I suggest Eclipse for this language.</p>
download java JDK: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads

    
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using your bash :
   
   git clone https://github.com/devbossma/javacore.git
2. Main.java is the entry of all execution topics and you have to uncomment each 'class.method()' in the public static void main() method in order to get the result in the console.
   but the explication of each topic is defined in its own class declaration file
   Ex: in the src Directory you will find a Main.java -> in this class you will find a public static void main() method -> in this Method you will find a commented line -> //DataTypes.primitiveDataTypes();
       so you should uncomment this line of code and run your code. To see the source code for this class go back to the src directory and search for DataTypes.java then the static method primitiveDataTypes.
       now you can start modifying each variable value and run the code again to see the result after your modification.
   
4. Refer to the "Resources" section for additional learning materials.
